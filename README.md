- 👋 Hi, I’m @abuzer1234   (cenk gumus - pikachu_p@aol.com).
            I am here to have social media presence to have a better chance of getting a coding job (I have no social media thing other than gitHub).

- 👀 I’m interested in all kinds of nerd stuff, because I am 'hardcore' nerd! (and I am PROUD to be a Nerd and intelligent!!!) (I can't call
          my-self a 'geek', because I am  socially-crippled.)

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Blockchain and DeFi.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on DeFi, Blockchain, Game development...   (I am betting on more than one horse, and if my efforts give 'fruit', I will change my name from Cenk Gumus to Bill Gates,jr.  - by the way, I admire Mr.Gates very much). 

- 📫 How to reach me :     you can e-mail me at pikachu_p@aol.com ,

If you have a lot of free time, then read on:

I first connected the Internet in 1996 from civil engineering computer lab of M.E.T.U. .  In those days decent computers were very expensive and we could only effort a monochrome CGA 8086 "computer". I never had online presence (not even a vanilla-HTML web page), mostly because of the fact that web sites were being hacked and de-faced (and I am a nerd which has hard time sociallizing , even online).
