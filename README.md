- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @abuzer1234   (cenk gumus - pikachu_p@aol.com).
            I am here to have social media presence to have a better chance of getting a coding job (I have no social media thing other than gitHub).

- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in all kinds of nerd stuff, because I am 'hardcore' nerd! (and I am PROUD to be a Nerd and intelligent!!!) (I can't call
          my-self a 'geek', because I am  socially-crippled.)

- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning Blockchain and DeFi.

- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on DeFi, Blockchain, Game development...   (I am betting on more than one horse, and if my efforts give 'fruit', I will change my name from Cenk Gumus to Bill Gates,jr.  - by the way, I admire Mr.Gates very much). 

- üì´ How to reach me :     you can e-mail me at pikachu_p@aol.com ,  text me or call me at +905548813305 (I would rather choose to be text on this number because the sound quality on my side is very low), and    whatsapp: +905449086486  (I would check this when it is about 10:00 am in New York).

// this is the three-line graphics programming example for beginners  (graphics programming only in 3 lines!)  
// it can be turned to an image viewer easily
// requires Turbo C++ to compile
// you have to select at least the 'Large' memory model on Turbo C++ if you want to run this code
// windows doesn't let you to assign values to the content of pointers, so it won't run on windows - only on MS-DOS
// this code is public domain (even the windows 2000 programming stuff is worthless now and this is much much older DOS stuff.)
// Notes:
// Turbo C++ doesn't accept the expression:      using namespace std;

#include <iostream.h>

void main(){

char *pc;                           // define a pointer to char
pc =  (char *) 0xb8000000;          // the pointer points to the beginning address of video buffer in RAM (this value is for color screens).
*pc = 64;                           // the character at the top left corner of the screen turns to @

cin >> i; 
}


// If you want to manipulate pixels instead of changing characters on the screen, you have to add these lines: 
// #include <DOS.h>             // this line is necessary to be able to call int86() function
//
//  union REGS in, out;
//  in.h.ah = 0;
//  in.h.al = 0x0d;            //this values (hexadecimal 0x0d) is for EGA mode (you may try to change this value to 0x13 to change the screen mode to VGA) 
//  int86(0x10, &in, &out);    //   calls the MS-DOS interrupt 0x10  which changes the graphics mode to EGA
// 
// 
// To change the color of top-left-most pixel, we assign the memory location 0xb800000 an arbirarly chosen value     . To change the color of the pixel next to the top-left-most pixel, you change the value of the

If you have a lot of free time, then read on:

I first connected the Internet in 1996 from civil engineering computer lab of M.E.T.U. .  In those days decent computers were very expensive and we could only effort a monochrome CGA 8086 "computer" (the modems were very expensive, we didn't have a second line, phone calls were very costyly, ISP fees were high,etc  - so I couldn't log-on to the Internet from the comfort of my home). I never had online presence (not even a vanilla-HTML web page), mostly because of the fact that web sites were being hacked and de-faced (and I am a nerd which has hard time sociallizing , even online).
